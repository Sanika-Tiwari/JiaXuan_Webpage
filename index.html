  <p>Me and my BFF, Jia Xuan, became best friends becuase both of us shared the same secrets. The next day, we told each other that we could be BFFs. We kept our friendship intact by sharing a special gem collection. We also took a photo with each other on National Day 2021 in school. Since then, our friendship has grown stronger. Jia Xuan is my BESTest BEST friend EVER!! =)</p>
